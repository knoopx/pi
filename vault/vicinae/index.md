# Vicinae

Vicinae is a keyboard-driven command launcher for Linux, inspired by [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/).

## Getting started

[Install Vicinae](/install/repo) and then follow the quickstart guide for your environment.

## Philosophy

Vicinae aims to be a shortcut for most simple actions on your system. It ships with a broad feature set and integrates seamlessly with native OS features like window management and clipboard.

For anything too niche for the core, Vicinae can be extended via [dmenu mode](/dmenu), [script commands](/scripts/getting-started), or [full extensions built with React and TypeScript](/extensions/introduction).

Extensions made by the [community](https://github.com/vicinaehq/extensions) can be installed from vicinae itself in a few clicks.

## Performance

Vicinae is built with performance in mind. When given the choice, vicinae will prefer to cache things in memory to lower CPU usage in order to keep battery drain minimal and remain snappy.

## Raycast compatibility

One of Vicinae's flagship features is its compatibility with the Raycast ecosystem.

The design is similar, but Vicinae does some things differently and unlocks things that Raycast locks behind a paywall, such as theming and window management APIs.
