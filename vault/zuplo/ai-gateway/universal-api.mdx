Zuplo AI Gateway provides a universal API that standardizes interactions with various AI providers.

## Using the Universal API

The Universal API is automatically enabled for all AI Gateway applications.

If you are using an SDK or library that supports custom base URLs, you can configure it to use your Zuplo application's URL.

```ts
import OpenAI from "openai";

const client = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.ZUPLO_API_KEY,
  baseURL: "https://my-ai-gateway.zuplo.app/v1",
});

const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn.",
    },
  ],
});

console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
```
