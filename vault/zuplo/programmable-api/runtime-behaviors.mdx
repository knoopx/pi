title: Runtime Behaviors
---

Zuplo's core gateway runtime is built on [open web-standards](./web-standard-apis.mdx).

Because some legacy APIs may require non-standard behavior, most of these behaviors can be modified for your particular deployment.

## Request.body

The [standard](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/body) for `Request.body` specifies that on `GET` and `HEAD` requests the value must be `null`.

By default, Zuplo will return a 500 error in the event that a `GET` or `HEAD` request has a body.
