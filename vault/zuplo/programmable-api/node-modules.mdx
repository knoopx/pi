Zuplo itself doesn't run Node.js, but instead runs a custom JavaScript engine that's designed to be fast and secure.

## Custom Modules

If you would like to use a node module, you can bundle modules inside of your own project.

You can find a complete example of how to bundle your own node modules in the [Bundling Custom Node Modules example](https://github.com/zuplo/zuplo/tree/main/examples/custom-module).

The process is typically as quick as running the following commands:

```bash
npm install your-package-name
npx tsdown ./node_modules/your-package-name --format esm --platform browser --out-dir ./modules/third-party/your-package-name
```

The module can then be imported and used in your Zuplo project like so:

```ts
import { YourPackage } from "./modules/third-party/your-package-name.mjs";
```

Be sure to test your bundled code thoroughly to ensure it works as expected in the Zuplo environment.

## Bundled Node Modules

:::danger{title="Deprecated"}

Using the bundled node modules is no longer recommended. As these modules are used by multiple customers, they may not be the version you need or may not work as you expect.

Below are the currently installed modules.

:::caution{title="Test Carefully"}

It's important to test your use of any node module carefully. Zuplo doesn't run Node.js, it runs a custom JavaScript engine that's designed to be fast and secure.

When developing in the Zuplo portal using the bundled modules, you will see a red underline on the module types.
