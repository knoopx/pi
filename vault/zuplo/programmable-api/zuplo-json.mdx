title: Zuplo Project Configuration (zuplo.jsonc)
sidebar_label: Project Configuration
---

Certain project-level settings can be configured using the `zuplo.jsonc` file at the root of a project.

The default `zuplo.jsonc` file is shown below. The only current valid `version` of the file is `1`.

```jsonc
{
  "version": 1,
  "compatibilityDate": "2025-02-06",
  "projectType": "managed-edge",
}
```

:::warning

The `zuplo.jsonc` file isn't currently shown or editable in the Zuplo portal.

:::

## `compatibilityDate`

The `compatibilityDate` field in the `zuplo.jsonc` file allows you to lock in the behavior of the runtime environment for your project.

Refer to the [documentation](./compatibility-dates.mdx) for compatibility dates and their changes.

```jsonc
{
  "version": 1,
  "compatibilityDate": "2025-02-06",
}
```

## `projectType`

The `projectType` field in the `zuplo.jsonc` file allows you to specify the type of your project.

- `managed-edge`: (default) Projects that are deployed to Zuplo's managed edge
environment.
- `managed-dedicated`: Projects that are deployed to your managed dedicated
environment.
- `self-hosted`: Projects that are deployed to your own infrastructure.

```jsonc
{
  "version": 1,
  "projectType": "managed-edge",
}
```

## `allowDuplicateRoutes`

Allow duplicate routes (same method and path) to be defined. This isn't recommended as it can lead to unexpected behavior.

```jsonc
{
  "version": 1,
  "allowDuplicateRoutes": true,
}
```

## `allowHostHeaderOverride`

Allow the Host header to be overridden by the client. This configuration defaults to `false`.

```jsonc
{
  "version": 1,
  "allowHostHeaderOverride": true,
}
```
