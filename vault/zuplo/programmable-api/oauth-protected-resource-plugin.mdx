title: OAuth Protected Resource Plugin
---

The `OAuthProtectedResourcePlugin` allows you to configure your Zuplo gateway to support OAuth protected resources through the `.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` endpoint.

This is particularly useful when building an MCP Server on Zuplo. See the [MCP Server Handler docs](../handlers/mcp-server.md#oauth-authentication) for more details.

## Usage

This runtime plugin will register the `.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` route on your behalf.

```ts
import {
  RuntimeExtensions,
  OAuthProtectedResourcePlugin,
} from "@zuplo/runtime";

export function runtimeInit(runtime: RuntimeExtensions) {
  runtime.addPlugin(
    new OAuthProtectedResourcePlugin({
      authorizationServers: ["https://your-auth0-domain.us.auth0.com"],
      resourceName: "My MCP OAuth Resource",
    }),
  );
}
```

As per the MCP OAuth specification, you _must_ use the canonical URL of your authorization server as the `authorizationServers` value.

the `.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` endpoint explicitly has a CORS policy of `anything-goes` since this is a public endpoint that should be accessible to anyone to check the server's OAuth configuration.
