Zuplo supports GitOps workflows for managing your API Gateway configuration.

You will use the Zuplo CLI to deploy your API using CI/CD pipelines or using one of the Zuplo's [Git integrations](../articles/source-control.mdx).

## Create a Local Project

To begin developing your API, you will need to create a local project.

```bash
npx create-zuplo-api@latest
```

This command will prompt you to enter a project name and options for your project.

## Create a Git Repository

Next, you will need to create a Git repository to store your API Gateway configuration.

Your new Zuplo project is already initialized as a git repo, so you need to add a remote repository and push your changes.

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/my-org/my-repo
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main
```

## GitHub: Connect Zuplo to your Repository

If you are using GitHub, you can connect your Zuplo project to your GitHub repository using the Zuplo integration.

For the full instructions on how to connect your Zuplo project to GitHub, see [GitHub Integration](../articles/source-control-setup-github.mdx).

## Custom CI: Deploy your API

If you aren't using GitHub, or would like to setup a custom CI/CD pipeline, you can use the Zuplo CLI to deploy your API Gateway.

```bash
npx zuplo deploy --api-key $ZUPLO_API_KEY --project your-project-name --environment my-env
```

For more information on setting up a CI/CD pipeline, see [CI/CD](../articles/custom-ci-cd.mdx) and the [Zuplo CLI Deployment](../cli/deploy.mdx) docs.
