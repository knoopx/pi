When running managed dedicated on the Akamai Cloud, you need to set up 2 CDNs, one for your API endpoint deployments, and one for your developer portal.

This document outlines the configurations you need to add to your Akamai CDNs to set them up to access your API gateway and developer portal.

All configurations in this guide were done on the Akamai Property Manager, see the [Akamai docs](https://techdocs.akamai.com/property-mgr/docs/know-your-around) for more details.

### Domains

Before you configure the CDN for your API Gateway and Developer Portal, you will to decide how you would like your domains to be setup.

For preview environments, you will use wildcard domains so that each environment (normally each git branch) will have its own subdomain.

For production, you will want to use friendly domains like `api.example.com` and `developers.example.com`.

The setup for both configurations is the same, but the domain name and certificates will be different.

### Prerequisites

1. Provision the domains that you would like these CDNs to have and certificates
for those domains, according to the domain section.
2. Request the Origin URLs for your API gateway and developer portal from your
Zuplo account manager.
3. Let your Zuplo account manager know what hostnames/domains you will be using
in your CDNs.

## API Gateway CDN

This section guides you on how to configure your API Gateway CDN.

Add the API gateway domain you provisioned to the Property Hostname for the API Gateway CDN.

An example of how you might configure your API Gateway CDN domains for your preview environment and your production environment is below.

![Configure multiple host names](../../../public/media/managed-dedicated-akamai/multiple_hostname_domains.png)

In this example, the preview environment domain is the wildcard domain `*.zuplo.apidemo.org`, and the production domain is `ftest.zuplo.apidemo.org`.

After configuring the CDN domains, make the following behavior changes:

1. Create a Set Variable behavior with the following configurations (also shown
in the screenshot below):

a. Create a variable.

b. The "Create Value From" field should be "Extract".

c. The "Get Data From" field should be "Request Header".

d. The "Header Name" field should be "Host".

e. The "Operation" field should be "Substitute (Regular Expression)".

f. The "Regex" field should be ^([^.]+)\..\*$.

g. The "Replacement" field should be something like $1.your-account.zuplo.work.

h. Case Sensitive and Global Substitution should be set to "Off".

2. Configure the Origin URL to point to the URL given to you by Zuplo for your
API gateway. Ensure that the Forward Host Header is configured to be the a Custom Value, and the value should be the variable you created in the previous step.

3. Turn on Content Targeting (Edgescape) in the Geolocation rule in the Property
Manager Sidebar. ![Geolocation](../../../public/media/managed-dedicated-akamai/geolocation.png)
4. Enable all Allowed Methods rules (POST, OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) in the
Property Manager sidebar.

## Developer Portal CDN

This section guides you on how to set up the Developer Portal CDN.

Add the Developer Portal gateway domain you provisioned to the Property Hostname for the API Gateway CDN.

An example of how you might configure your Developer Portal CDN domains for your preview environment and your production environment is below.

![Configure multiple host names](../../../public/media/managed-dedicated-akamai/multiple_hostname_domains.png)

In this example, the preview environment domain is the wildcard domain `*.zuplo.apidemo.org`, and the production domain is `ftest.zuplo.apidemo.org`.

Under the Default Rule page, add the following behaviors:

1.  Configure the origin URL to be the URL given to be the one given to you by
Zuplo for your Developer Portal. This will look similarly to how you configured it for your API Gateway CDN.

2.  Modify Incoming Request Header behavior, with the following fields:
    - Action: Add
    - Select Header Name: Other
    - Custom Header Name: `X-Forwarded-Host`
    - Header Value: `\{\{builtin.AK_HOST\}\}`.

This should look like the picture below:

![Dev portal CDN base path and incoming header behaviors](../../../public/media/managed-dedicated-akamai/default_rule_dev_portal_config.png)

3.  Caching, which should have the following configurations: Caching Option
should be set to "Honor origin Cache-Control and Expires", Force Validation of stale objects should be set to "Always revalidate with origin", Default Maxage should be set to 0 seconds, and all the Cache-Control header directives should be enabled.

Congratulations, you've set up your Akamai CDN to serve your API Gateway and Developer Portal!
