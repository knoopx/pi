Zuplo's managed dedicated instances are highly available, scalable, and secure.

## Components

A managed dedicated instance of Zuplo consists of the following components:

- **API Gateway**: The API Gateway is the core component of Zuplo. It receives
incoming requests, routes them to the appropriate backend, and returns the response to the client.
- **Gateway Services**: Zuplo, being a highly distributed API Gateway, uses
services to facilitate features such as [Rate Limiting](../articles/step-2-add-rate-limiting.mdx) and [API Key Authentication](../articles/api-key-management.mdx).
- **Control Plane**: The Control Plane manages the configuration of the API
Gateway. It deploys new configurations, manages the lifecycle of the API Gateway, and monitors its health.
- **Analytics and Logging**: Zuplo provides analytics and logging for your API
Gateway. This includes request/response logging, error logging, and analytics on request volume, latency, and other metrics.
- **Developer Portal**: The Developer Portal is a web-based interface that
enables developers to interact with your API. It provides documentation, testing tools, and other features to help developers integrate with your API.

## Custom requirements

Customize a managed dedicated instance of Zuplo to meet your specific requirements.

- **Regions & Availability Zones** - Zuplo can deploy to multiple regions,
availability zones, or data centers to provide high availability and low latency.
- **Developer Portal Hosting** - Zuplo manages the developer portal hosting from
a CDN. By default, the developer portal's static assets serve from a global CDN.
- **Networking** - Zuplo can deploy with a variety of network configurations. To
learn more, see [Networking](./networking.mdx).
- **Disabling Features** - Zuplo can disable unnecessary features for specific
use cases or those that don't meet security or compliance requirements.
- **Custom Logging & Monitoring** - Zuplo can integrate with your existing
logging and monitoring systems. Logs and other data go directly from the API Gateway to your logging provider.

## Security

All deployment models of Zuplo are secure and provide isolation between each customer and environment.

- **IAM Authorization**: Managed dedicated instances of Zuplo can use the IAM
capabilities to control traffic between the API Gateway and other services.
- **Encryption**: Zuplo encrypts data both in transit and at rest. TLS secures
all data sent to or from the API Gateway. Zuplo encrypts stored data at rest.
- **Access Control**: Zuplo provides robust authentication and access control
mechanisms. You control who has access to your API Gateway management capabilities, what they can do, and what data they can access.
- **Audit Logs**: Zuplo provides detailed audit logs of all management
operations. You can see who did what, when they did it, and what data they accessed.

## Architecture

The architecture of a managed dedicated instance of Zuplo provides you with all the benefits of a SaaS platform while giving you the control and isolation of a dedicated instance.

The following diagram shows the high-level architecture of a managed dedicated instance of Zuplo and how the components interact with each other.

### Deployments

When you deploy to your managed dedicated instance of Zuplo, you upload your source code and configuration files to the Control Plane.

If you use Zuplo's Developer Portal, the control plane also deploys the web application that powers the Developer Portal.

  <DiagramEdge from="source" to="control" label="Deploy" />
  <DiagramEdge from="control" to="gateway" />
  <DiagramEdge from="control" to="portal" />
</Diagram>

### Multiple regions

It's common practice to deploy your API Gateway to multiple regions to provide higher availability, lower latency, and meet regulatory requirements.

When you deploy your API Gateway to multiple regions, Zuplo uses a global load balancer to route traffic to the closest region.

  <DiagramNode id="client">Client</DiagramNode>
  <DiagramNode id="lb">Load Balancer</DiagramNode>
  <DiagramNode id="region1" variant="zuplo">
    API Gateway (Region 1)
  </DiagramNode>
  <DiagramNode id="region2" variant="zuplo">
    API Gateway (Region 2)
  </DiagramNode>
  <DiagramNode id="region3" variant="zuplo">
    API Gateway (Region 3)
  </DiagramNode>
  <DiagramEdge from="client" to="lb" />
  <DiagramEdge from="lb" to="region1" />
  <DiagramEdge from="lb" to="region2" />
  <DiagramEdge from="lb" to="region3" />
</Diagram>

### Instances

Customers running managed dedicated Zuplo typically have multiple instances of Zuplo deployed.

Each instance operates in isolation and runs within its own VPC or network.

It's possible to have multiple instances depending on your requirements.

During the onboarding process to Zuplo, an account manager will assist in determining the configuration that best meets the requirements.

The most common setup is where your `main` branch deploys to production and all other branches deploy to a non-production environment, but this is fully customizable.
