The OpenAPI Spec handler can be used to serve a public version of your OpenAPI specification file.

## Setup via Portal

The Forward Handler can be added to any route using the Route Designer.

The handler should be defaulted to the OpenAPI file you currently have open, but you can change it to serve a different OpenAPI file via the dropdown.

## Setup via routes.oas.json

The OpenAPI Spec handler can also be added manually to the **routes.oas.json** file with the following route configuration.

```json
"paths": {
  "/open-api-spec": {
    "get": {
      "summary": "New Route",
      "x-zuplo-route": {
        "corsPolicy": "none",
        "handler": {
          "export": "openApiSpecHandler",
          "module": "$import(@zuplo/runtime)",
          "options": {
            "openApiFilePath": "./config/routes.oas.json"
          }
        },
        "policies": {
          "inbound": []
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Options

The OpenAPI Spec handler can be configured via `options` as follows:

- `openApiFilePath` - the file path of an OpenAPI file within the `config`
folder. The file name must end with `.oas.json`.
