# Zuplo Self-Hosted

Zuplo Self-Hosted (also known as on-premises) is a deployment model where you run Zuplo on your own infrastructure in any cloud or private data center.

Self-hosted deployment might be the right choice for you if you need:

- Complete control over your infrastructure and deployment environment
- To run Zuplo in a private data center or on-premises environment
- To meet strict data sovereignty or regulatory requirements that require data to remain within your infrastructure
- To integrate with existing on-premises systems and networks
- To customize the deployment architecture to match your organization's specific requirements

# Deployment Options

Zuplo Self-Hosted offers two deployment models:

## Hybrid Deployment

In a hybrid deployment, you run the Zuplo API Gateway on your infrastructure while leveraging shared services for features such as rate limiting.

## Full Self-Hosted

In a full self-hosted deployment, you run all Zuplo components on your infrastructure.

# Features

The self-hosted deployment model provides the same core features as other Zuplo deployment models.

In addition to the standard features, self-hosted deployment provides:

- **Kubernetes-Based**: Deploy to any Kubernetes environment using simple Helm charts
- **Complete Control**: Full control over your infrastructure, networking, and security configurations
- **Data Sovereignty**: Keep all data and processing within your infrastructure
- **Custom Networking**: Integrate with your existing network architecture and security policies
- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory and compliance requirements that require on-premises deployment
