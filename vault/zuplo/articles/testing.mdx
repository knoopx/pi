:::tip

These instructions assume that you are using custom GitHub Action workflow, in conjunction with the Zuplo Git Integration.

:::

Using the Zuplo GitHub integration, tests can be run after a deployment with the Zuplo Git Integration and used to block pull requests from being merged.

The Zuplo Git Integration sets [Deployments](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/deployments/deployments) and [Deployment Statuses](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/deployments/statuses) for any push to a GitHub branch.

Here is a simple GitHub Action that uses the Zuplo CLI to run the tests after the deployment is successful.

```yaml title="/.github/workflows/main.yaml"
name: Main
on: [deployment_status]

jobs:
  test:
    name: Test API Gateway
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version-file: ".nvmrc"

      - name: Run Tests
        # Useful properties 'environment', 'state', and 'environment_url'
        run:
          API_URL=${{ toJson(github.event.deployment_status.environment_url) }}
          npx zuplo test --endpoint $API_URL
```

[GitHub Branch protection](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches) can be set in order to enforce policies on when a Pull Request can be merged.

When a developer tries to merge their pull request, they will see that the tests haven't passed and the pull request can't be merged.

## Writing Tests

Using Node.js 18 and the Zuplo CLI, it's easy to write tests that make requests to your API using `fetch` and then validate expectations with `expect` from [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/api/bdd/).

```js title="/tests/my-test.test.ts"
import { describe, it, TestHelper } from "@zuplo/test";
import { expect } from "chai";

describe("API", () => {
  it("should have a body", async () => {
    const response = await fetch(TestHelper.TEST_URL);
    const result = await response.text();
    expect(result).to.equal(JSON.stringify("What zup?"));
  });
});
```

Check out our [other sample tests](https://github.com/zuplo/zup-cli-example-project/tree/main/tests) to find one that matches your use-case.

:::tip

Your test files need to be under the `tests` folder and end with `.test.ts` to be picked up by the Zuplo CLI.

## Tips for writing tests

This section highlights some of the features of the Zuplo CLI that can help you write and structure your tests.

### Ignoring tests

You can use `.ignore` and `.only` to ignore or run only specific test.

```js title="/tests/ignore-only.test.ts"
import { describe, it } from "@zuplo/test";
import { expect } from "chai";

/**
 * This example how to use ignore and only.
 */
describe("Ignore and only test example", () => {
  it.ignore("This is a failing test but it's been ignored", () => {
    expect(1 + 4).to.equals(6);
  });

  //   it.only("This is the only test that would run if it weren't commented out", () => {
  //     expect(1 + 4).to.equals(5);
  //   });
});
```

### Filtering tests

You can use the CLI to filter tests by name or regex. The full example is at [filter.test.ts](https://github.com/zuplo/zup-cli-example-project/blob/main/tests/filter.test.ts)

```js title="/tests/filter.test.ts"
import { describe, it } from "@zuplo/test";
import { expect } from "chai";

/**
 * This example shows how to filter the test by the name in the describe() function.
 * You can run `zuplo test --filter '#labelA'`
 * If you want to use regex, you can do `zuplo test --filter '/#label[Aa]/'`
 */
describe("[#labelA #labelB] Addition", () => {
  it("should add positive numbers", () => {
    expect(1 + 4).to.equals(5);
  });
});
```

## Unit Tests & Mocking

:::caution{title="Advanced"}

Custom testing can be complicated and is best used only to test your own logic rather than trying to mock large portions of your API Gateway.

:::

It's usually possible to use test frameworks like [Mocha](https://github.com/zuplo/zuplo/tree/main/examples/test-mocks) and mocking tools like [Sinon](https://sinonjs.org/) to unit tests handlers, policies, or other modules.

Do note though that not everything in the Zuplo runtime can be mocked.

Generally speaking, if you must write unit tests, it's best to test your logic separately from the Zuplo runtime.

For example, if you have a function that uses an environment variable and want to unit test it.

Don't do this:

```ts
import { environment } from "@zuplo/runtime";

export function myFunction() {
  const myVar = environment.MY_ENV_VAR;
  return `Hello ${myVar}`;
}
```

Instead do this:

```ts
export function myFunction(myVar: string) {
  return `Hello ${myVar}`;
}
```

Then write your test like this:

```ts
import { myFunction } from "./myFunction";

describe("myFunction", () => {
  it("should return Hello World", () => {
    expect(myFunction("World")).to.equal("Hello World");
  });
});
```

### Polyfills

If you are running unit tests in a Node.js environment, you may need to polyfill some globals.

If you are running on Node.js 20 or later, you can use the `webcrypto` module to polyfill the `crypto` global.

```js
import { webcrypto } from "node:crypto";
if (typeof crypto === "undefined") {
  globalThis.crypto = webcrypto;
}
```
