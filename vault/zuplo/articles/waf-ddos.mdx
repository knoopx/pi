title: Zuplo + WAF/DDoS Services
---

A common setup for customers using Zuplo (or any API Gateway) is how to setup a WAF and DDoS protection in front of their API Gateway.

When picking WAF + DDoS services to run in front of your Zuplo API Gateway consider the following:

- What level of customization do you require for your WAF + DDoS? If common
configurations are enough, consider Zuplo Managed WAF.
- Is your WAF/DDoS service also deployed at the edge?
- How can you ensure that requests can't bypass your WAF/DDoS and make requests
directly to your API Gateway?

## Zuplo Managed WAF

Zuplo offers different WAF solutions based on your deployment model:

**Managed Edge Deployment:** Customers on Zuplo's enterprise plans using our managed edge deployment can use Zuplo Managed WAF.

**Managed Dedicated Deployment:** Customers using Zuplo's managed dedicated deployment model can leverage custom WAF and DDoS configurations based on the capabilities of their chosen cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP).

For detailed information about Zuplo Managed WAF for managed edge deployments, see our [Zuplo Managed WAF guide](./zuplo-waf.mdx).

:::tip

Many common WAF functions can be implemented directly in Zuplo using policies, without the need for a separate WAF service:

- **IP Restriction** - Block or allow requests from specific IP addresses using
the [IP Restriction policy](../policies/ip-restriction-inbound)
- **Geolocation Blocking** - Route or block requests based on country using
  [custom policies](../guides/geolocation-backend-routing)
- **Rate Limiting** - Protect against abuse with built-in
  [rate limiting policies](../policies/rate-limit-inbound)
- **Custom Rules** - Create any custom security logic with
  [custom code policies](../policies/custom-code-inbound)

These policies run at the edge with your API, ensuring no additional latency while providing powerful security capabilities.

## Third-Party WAF Solutions

If you require the ability to finely control your WAF Rules or are using a third-party WAF provider, Zuplo integrates seamlessly with popular edge-based WAF solutions.

### Cloudflare WAF + DDoS

Cloudflare is the easiest solution for custom WAF + DDoS in front of your Zuplo API Gateway.

A custom domain configured on Zuplo that utilizes Cloudflare DNS is completely protected from requests bypassing your WAF and hitting Zuplo directly.
