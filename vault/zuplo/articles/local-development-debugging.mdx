You can debug your local gateway through VS Code using its TypeScript debugger.

1. Create a `.vscode/launch.json` file with the following content. If you
already have an older/existing `.vscode/launch.json` file, you can add the section in the curly braces to the configurations array.

```json
{
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Zuplo Gateway",
      "type": "node",
      "request": "attach",
      "restart": true,
      "port": 9229
    }
  ]
}
```

2. Start the gateway in debug mode using the port that you specified above.

```bash
npx zuplo dev --debug-port 9229
```

3. Switch to the View > Run and Debug in VS Code. You can now attach the
debugger by selecting **Zuplo Gateway** and clicking the green triangle.

## Limitations

- We only support stepping through your own module code. System code provided by
Zuplo are minified and stripped of source maps, so you won't be able to step through them.
