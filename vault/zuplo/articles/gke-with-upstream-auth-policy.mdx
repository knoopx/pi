title: Secure a GCP Backend with Zuplo Upstream Auth
sidebar_label: GCP Backend with Upstream Auth
---

When using any API gateway as your API's entry point, it's critical that only traffic that originates from the Gateway is allowed to call your backend.

Using GCP IAM to authorize your Zuplo Gateway to make requests to your backend utilizes Googles core IAM system known as "[Identity Aware Proxy](https://cloud.google.com/iap)" to secure public IP address from unauthorized access.

While it's also possible to enforce authorization within your application itself - for example using JWT Authentication.

:::note

This article uses GKE as the example backend, but any GCP service that can be setup behind an HTTP Load Balancer can be used.

:::

The diagram below shows how the end-to-end system interacts. The important steps to this process are:

1. The client makes a request to your Zuplo API Gateway
1. The Zuplo API Gateway enforces any policies (for example authentication,
authorization, rate limiting)
1. The Zuplo API Gateway proxies the request to the public IP address of your
GCP Load Balancer. Zuplo adds authorization information to the request that identify the request as coming from Zuplo
1. GCP Identity Aware proxy validates that the request comes from an authorized
Service Account identity. Unauthorized requests are rejected.
1. Authorized requests are forwarded on through your GKE ingress to your
backend.

## Zuplo Gateway Identity

Requests that are proxied from Zuplo to your GCP Load Balancer use the [Upstream GCP Service Auth Policy](../policies/upstream-gcp-service-auth-inbound.mdx) to authenticate the request via a [GCP Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview).

Using this system means that you can uniquely identify requests that come from Zuplo as a their own identity.

:::tip{title="Multiple Service Account"}

While not normally needed, it's possible to configure multiple Upstream GCP Service Auth Inbound policies in order to provide fine-grain authorization to your internal resources by Service Account.

:::

For instructions on how to configure upstream GCP IAM auth, see the [Upstream GCP Service Auth Policy document](../policies/upstream-gcp-service-auth-inbound.mdx)

## GCP Configuration

Documentation on configuring GCP Identity Aware Proxy can be found on Google's documentation.

- [Enabling IAP for Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/enabling-compute-howto)
- [Enabling IAP for GKE](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/enabling-kubernetes-howto)
- [Enabling IAP for Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/enabling-cloud-run)

:::tip{title="Cloud Run"}

Cloud Run doesn't need to use IAP in all cases. It's possible to restrict Cloud Run to [require IAM authentication in order to invoke the service](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/securing/managing-access).

:::

## Example

To see how this works in action, follow the steps in Google's document _[Set up an external Application Load Balancer with Ingress](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/http-balancer)_.

You can test the request with a simple curl command.

```shell
curl http://34.111.91.10/
Hello, world!
Version: 1.0.0
Hostname: web-58756b54cc-7hdcw
```

securely proxy traffic from Zuplo to GCP, you'll need to secure your traffic over an SSL connection.

![Edit load balancer](../../public/media/gke-with-upstream-auth-policy/770db332-ad94-41c6-a6f8-1498578fb78c.png)

Next, click **ADD FRONTEND IP AND PORT**. Enter the name and select **HTTPS** as the protocol.

![Add new frontend IP and port](../../public/media/gke-with-upstream-auth-policy/cd0b20d3-c109-4775-9fa0-1b3e391bcb84.png)

Then click **Add a Certificate**. Select Google-managed Certificate and enter your domain name.

![Add a certificate](../../public/media/gke-with-upstream-auth-policy/49760fbb-6eb4-46f9-a638-ac078fe85aab.png)

Next, select **Host and path rules** and enter the domain and associate it with the backend.

![Host and path rules configuration](../../public/media/gke-with-upstream-auth-policy/307e9026-d77e-4efd-9fc1-4c45ead963f1.png)

Click **Done** and then **Update** to update your Load Balancer. It will take a few minutes to issue the SSL certificate for the domain.

After the Load Balancer updates you should be able to request your site using the configured domain via HTTPS.

```shell
curl https://api.example.com
Hello, world!
Version: 1.0.0
Hostname: web-58756b54cc-7hdcw
```

:::tip{title="Checkpoint"}

At this point, your backend on GKE is exposed on the public internet via a GCP HTTP Load Balancer via HTTP and HTTPS.

### Enabling Identity Aware Proxy

To enable Identity Aware Proxy on your Load Balancer, follow googles document _[Enabling IAP for GKE](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/enabling-kubernetes-howto)_

After you have enabled IAP, if you try to open your example API in the browser you will now be prompted to authenticate using your Google Account.

![You don't have access](../../public/media/gke-with-upstream-auth-policy/a2ee889a-54c1-4e00-953b-1053c619ce52.png)

Your API is now completely inaccessible to unauthorized requests.

allow your Zuplo Gateway access you need to [grant it's service account permission](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/managing-access) to call the IAP protected API.

![Add principals](../../public/media/gke-with-upstream-auth-policy/ecadec32-753b-4716-afb5-fafa69c91499.png)

### Authorize Zuplo to Call the API

The last thing required is to configure Zuplo with a service account and policy so that it can securely call your API.

With the policy setup, create a route in your Zuplo portal that points to your API.

```shell
curl https://zuplo-gateway.example.com
Hello, world!
Version: 1.0.0
Hostname: web-58756b54cc-7hdcw
```

You can now add additional policies on Zuplo in order to authenticate requests, add rate limiting, etc.
