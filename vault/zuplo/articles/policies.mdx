Policies are modules that can intercept an incoming request or outgoing response.

## How policies work

![How Policies Work](../../public/media/policies/103f37f8-9801-4f37-8962-d516b9e12fbd.png)

An `inbound` policy can intercept a request and modify the request before it reaches the request handler (or the next policy).

An `outbound` policy intercepts the response from your request handler, allowing you to transform your response, or return a new one entirely.

## Built-In Policies

Zuplo includes many built-in policies that make it easy to handle things like authentication, validation, and request modification.

Explore the navigation to see all of the built-in policies.

## Custom Policies

The ability to write custom policies that run in-process of your Gateway is at the core of what makes Zuplo the Programmable API Gateway.
