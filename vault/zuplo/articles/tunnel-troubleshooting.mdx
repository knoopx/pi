title: Tunnel Troubleshooting

Setting up a secure tunnel involves configuring several different networks to work together.

## Tunnel status

As a first step, check if the tunnel is up and running. You can use the following CLI command to check the status of the tunnel:

```bash
# For brevity, the commands assume that you have exported your API key as an environment variable,
# export ZUPLO_API_KEY=zpka_d67b7e241bb948758f415b79aa8exxxx_2efbxxxx

zuplo tunnel list # Get the list of tunnels
zuplo tunnel describe --tunnel-id tnl_xxxxxxxxxxx # Narrow it down to the problematic tunnel
```

Check the `status` field from the output of `zuplo tunnel describe`. If it's "down" that means that your tunnel isn't up.

## Tunnel Logging

If the tunnel is up (as verified in the previous step) but you aren't seeing any traffic, you can inspect the logs to see if there are any network or IAM issues that might be blocking a connection.

The tunnel by default logs only errors. For the purposes of debugging, it's useful to set a more verbose log level.

The way you set an environment variable will vary depending on where you deployed the tunnel.

```txt
TUNNEL_LOGLEVEL=debug
```

Once you are done debugging, we recommend resetting the log level to something less verbose since the `debug` level can generate a lot of logs.
