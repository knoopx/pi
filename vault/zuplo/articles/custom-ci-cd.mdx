Custom CI/CD pipelines give you complete control over your deployment workflow.

:::tip{title="GitHub Users"}

If you use GitHub, you likely don't need custom CI/CD.

:::

Custom pipelines unlock:

- **Pre-deployment testing** — Tests must pass before anything deploys
- **Approval gates** — Require human approval for production
- **Tag-based releases** — Deploy only when you tag a release
- **Multi-stage workflows** — Staging → production with validation between

## Choose Your CI/CD Provider

- **[GitHub Actions](./custom-ci-cd-github.mdx)** — Workflows with approval
gates and multi-stage deployments
- **[Azure Pipelines](./custom-ci-cd-azure.mdx)** — Enterprise pipelines with
environment approvals
- **[GitLab CI/CD](./custom-ci-cd-gitlab.mdx)** — Integrated pipelines with
protected environments
- **[Bitbucket Pipelines](./custom-ci-cd-bitbucket.mdx)** — Repository-native
deployments with manual triggers
- **[CircleCI](./custom-ci-cd-circleci.mdx)** — Flexible workflows with approval
jobs

## How It Works

Every Zuplo project can be deployed via the [Zuplo CLI](../cli/overview.mdx).

- `zuplo deploy` — Deploy your API to Zuplo
- `zuplo test` — Run your test suite against any endpoint
- `zuplo delete` — Remove an environment when no longer needed
- `zuplo dev` — Start a local server for testing in CI

Branch names become environment names automatically. Push to `feature-auth` and you get a `feature-auth` environment.

:::warning{title="GitHub Users: Disconnect Automatic Deployments"}

If you're using GitHub with custom CI/CD, disconnect the built-in integration to prevent double deployments:

**Settings** > **Source Control** > **Disconnect**

GitLab, Bitbucket, and Azure DevOps don't have automatic deployments, so no disconnection is needed.

## Getting Your API Key

The CLI authenticates with an API key:

1. Go to [portal.zuplo.com](https://portal.zuplo.com)
2. Select your account
3. Navigate to **Settings** > **API Keys**

Store this as a secret in your CI/CD provider (typically `ZUPLO_API_KEY`).
