title: Securing your Backend with a Shared Secret
---

When using a gateway, it's important to ensure that your backend API only accepts traffic from the gateway.

## 1/ Set an Environment Variable

The first step is to set an [environment variable](./environment-variables.mdx) in your Zuplo project.

Open the _Settings_ section of your project and select _Environment Variables_.

![Set Environment Variable](../../public/media/securing-backend-shared-secret/image.png)

## 2/ Create a Set Header Policy

The next step is to create a policy that sets the `BACKEND_SECRET` as a header on the request to your backend API.

Navigate to the route you want to secure and add a new policy. Select the **Add or Set Request Headers** policy type and configure it as follows:

![Set Header Policy](../../public/media/securing-backend-shared-secret/image-1.png)

The configuration uses the environment variable via the `$env(BACKEND_SECRET)` selector as shown below.

```json
{
  "name": "set-backend-secret",
  "policyType": "set-headers-inbound",
  "handler": {
    "export": "SetHeadersInboundPolicy",
    "module": "$import(@zuplo/runtime)",
    "options": {
      "headers": [
        {
          "name": "backend-secret",
          "value": "$env(BACKEND_SECRET)"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Add this policy to any of the routes in your API that are calling your secure backend.

## 3/ Verify the Secret on your Backend

Finally, you need to verify the secret on your backend. The way you implement this depends on the framework and language you are using, but the typical pattern is to use a middleware to check the header value.

An example of this using a Node.js connect middleware is shown below.

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  if (req.headers["backend-secret"] !== process.env.BACKEND_SECRET) {
    return res.status(401).send("Unauthorized");
  }
  next();
});
```
