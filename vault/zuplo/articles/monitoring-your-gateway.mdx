Reliability and performance of your gateway are paramount. Zuplo's commitment to operational excellence aims to provide seamless, uninterrupted service.

Zuplo makes every effort to actively monitor our core services and deliver 100% up-time for your gateway.

### Common Sources of Disruptions

Several factors can compromise the functionality of your gateway, including but not limited to:

- Misconfigured environment variables: Simple errors like a misspelled URL or
incorrect shared secret can take your gateway down.
- Coding Errors: The flexibility of Zuplo allows for extensive customization
and, like any software, has the potential to cause disruption if bad code is deployed.

This means we strongly recommend that you have active end-to-end monitoring of each network configuration of your gateway.

## Pro-active monitoring

We recommend doing this by having a health check endpoint for each network configuration.

Some customers choose to go further, and have their backend health-check only return 'OK' if it also verifies other critical dependencies, like a database connection or dependent service, are also operational.

Most customers use a monitoring service, here are a few examples:

- [Checkly](https://checklyhq.com)
- [API Context](https://apicontext.com)
- [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/dg/apm/synthetics/api-test)

In addition, we recommend using our [Enterprise Log Plugins](./logging.mdx) to send log events to partners like Datadog and set up volume based alerts from any unusually increased error rates from your custom code or dependent services.
