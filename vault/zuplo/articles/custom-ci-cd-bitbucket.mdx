Bitbucket Pipelines brings CI/CD directly into your Bitbucket workflow.

## Why Bitbucket Pipelines with Zuplo?

The Zuplo CLI integrates naturally with Bitbucket's pipeline model:

**Integrated with Bitbucket** — Pipelines run automatically on pushes and pull requests.

**Branch and PR pipelines** — Define different pipelines for branches and pull requests.

**Deployment environments** — Track deployments with Bitbucket Deployments.

**Atlassian ecosystem** — Connect with Jira for deployment tracking. Link deployments to issues automatically.

## How It Works

The Zuplo CLI handles deployment and testing. Bitbucket Pipelines orchestrates your workflow:

```bash
# Deploy to Zuplo (environment name from branch or --environment flag)
npx zuplo deploy --api-key "$ZUPLO_API_KEY"

# Run tests against any Zuplo environment
npx zuplo test --endpoint https://your-env.zuplo.dev

# Clean up environments you no longer need
npx zuplo delete --environment pr-123 --api-key "$ZUPLO_API_KEY"

# Test locally before deploying
npx zuplo dev  # starts local server on port 9000
```

Use artifacts to pass the deployment URL between steps. Write the URL to a file and mark it as an artifact for subsequent steps.

## Prerequisites

1. **Disconnect Git integration** — If you're using Bitbucket Pipelines for
deployments, disconnect the native Git integration to avoid duplicate deployments.

2. **Add your API key** — Store your Zuplo API key as a repository variable. Go
to **Repository settings** > **Repository variables** and add `ZUPLO_API_KEY`.

## Examples

Start with the workflow that matches your needs:

- **[Basic Deployment](./ci-cd-bitbucket/basic-deployment.mdx)** — Deploy on
every push to main
- **[Deploy and Test](./ci-cd-bitbucket/deploy-and-test.mdx)** — Run tests after
deployment
- **[PR Preview Environments](./ci-cd-bitbucket/pr-preview-environments.mdx)** —
Isolated environments for pull requests
- **[Local Testing in CI](./ci-cd-bitbucket/local-testing.mdx)** — Test with
local Zuplo server before deploying
- **[Tag-Based Releases](./ci-cd-bitbucket/tag-based-releases.mdx)** — Deploy
only on tagged releases
- **[Multi-Stage Deployment](./ci-cd-bitbucket/multi-stage-deployment.mdx)** —
Staging to production with manual triggers
