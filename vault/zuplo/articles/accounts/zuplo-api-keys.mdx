The [Zuplo Developer API](https://dev.zuplo.com) allows you to programmatically interact with Zuplo.

API keys are used to authenticate requests to the Zuplo API. They're unique to your account and should be kept secret.

## Creating an API Key

To start, navigate to the account settings page by clicking your user icon in the top right corner of the screen and selecting "Settings" from the dropdown menu.

Account admins can view and manage all API keys in the account. Developers can only view their own API keys.

Select the "Create API Key" button to create a new API key. You can enter a label, expiration, and select the permissions for your new API key.

## Editing an API Key

API Keys are immutable once created. If you need to change the permissions you will need to create a new API key.

## Deleting an API Key

API Keys can be deleted by selecting the delete button on the list page or by opening the details page for the key and clicking the **Delete** button at the bottom of the page.
