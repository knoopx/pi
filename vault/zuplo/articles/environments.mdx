title: Environments

One of the things that makes Zuplo different from most API gateways, and API management platforms is that you can rapidly deploy many environments.

For a comprehensive guide to how branches map to environments, see [Branch-Based Deployments](./branch-based-deployments.mdx).

## Environment Types

There are three types of environments on Zuplo - Production, Preview, and Development (called Working Copy).

### Development (Working Copy)

This is your development environment. You can think of this as your personal cloud laptop.

### Preview

These are environments that are deployed using the [GitHub integration](/docs/articles/source-control.mdx) or building a [custom CI/CD pipeline](/docs/articles/custom-ci-cd.mdx).

### Production

These are environments that are deployed using the [GitHub integration](/docs/articles/source-control.mdx) or building a [custom CI/CD pipeline](/docs/articles/custom-ci-cd.mdx).

#### Changing the Production Environment

The Production environment is determined by your repository's **default branch** setting (configured in your Git provider, not Zuplo).

1. Go to your Git repository settings:
   - **GitHub**: Settings > General > Default branch
   - **GitLab**: Settings > Repository > Branch defaults
   - **Bitbucket**: Repository settings > Branching model
   - **Azure DevOps**: Project settings > Repositories > Default branch
2. Change the default branch to your desired branch
3. Zuplo automatically treats the new default branch as Production

:::caution

Changing the default branch affects which environment receives Production environment variables and uses the Production API key bucket.

### Preview vs Production Environments (or multiple Production Environments)

Note, there is no _technical_ difference between a **Preview** environment and a **Production** environment and some customers choose to use a specific (or multiple) Preview environments as 'Production' deployments of their API.

## Navigating Environments

On the bottom toolbar of the Zuplo portal you will see a selector for the current environment.

![Environments](../../public/media/environments/image.png)

Your development (working copy) environment will be listed at the top in a separate section.

For users using [source control integration](/docs/articles/source-control.mdx) the name of the deployment matches the branch name (yes - creating a new environment is literally as easy as creating a new branch).

You can't edit the code of an production or preview environment in portal.zuplo.com but you can switch into those environments to perform a number of functions, such as:

- edit API consumers for this environment
- view analytics for this environment
- view Live Logs for this environment

## Different Backends per Environment

It's common to want a different backend for your production, staging and preview environments.

For example

```json
${env.BASE_PATH}${pathname}
```

A url rewrite like this will combine the `BASE_PATH` environment variable, say `https://example.com` with the incoming path, for example `/foo/bar` to create a re-written URL:

```json
https://example.com/foo/bar
```
