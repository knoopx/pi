title: Step 4 - Deploying to the Edge
sidebar_label: "Step 4 - Deploy"
---

In this guide we'll show you how to deploy your gateway to the edge, at over 300 data-centers around the world.

In this tutorial we'll show the default workflow via GitHub, but note that we also support GitLab, BitBucket ([enterprise plan only](https://zuplo.com/pricing)) and [custom CI/CD](./custom-ci-cd).

To follow this tutorial you'll need

- a GitHub account (it's free, sign up at [github.com](https://github.com)).
- a zuplo project - complete [Step 1](./step-1-setup-basic-gateway.mdx),
[Step 2](./step-2-add-rate-limiting.mdx) and [Step 3](./step-3-add-api-key-auth.mdx) for a great start!
- to install the
[Zuplo GitHub deployment](https://github.com/apps/zuplo/installations/new) to GitHub - you can [follow these instructions](https://github.com/apps/zuplo/installations/new)

Let's get started:

<Stepper>

1. Authorize to GitHub

Next, go to your project in the Zuplo portal and open to the **Settings** tab, then select **Source Control**.

![Connect GitHub](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/image-1.png)

Next, a dialog will open asking you to authorize Zuplo. Click the **Authorize Zuplo** button.

   </Framed>

   <Callout type="tip" title="GitHub Permissions" >

The permission "Act on your behalf" sounds a bit scary - however, this is a standard GitHub permission and by default Zuplo can't actually do anything with this.

[read more about this permission on GitHub's docs](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/using-github-apps/authorizing-github-apps#about-github-apps-acting-on-your-behalf).

   </Callout>

After you have connected the GitHub app, it needs to be granted permission to edit a repository.

   </Framed>

Next, you will be asked to select the repositories that you want Zuplo to access.

   </Framed>

   <Callout type="caution" title="Existing Installation" >

The next step is only if you already have Zuplo installed in a GitHub org and need to add another organization.

   </Callout>

If you weren't prompted to select a GitHub org, it's likely that you are already a member of an account that has authorized Zuplo.

![Connect Org](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/image-2.png)

1. Connect GitHub to your Project

With your GitHub App configured, you can now return to the Zuplo portal.

![Create Repository](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/image-3.png)

In the GitHub UI, you can rename your repository if you want. Click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the page and return to the Zuplo Portal.

The portal will reload and you will see your new repository listed. Click **Connect** to connect Zuplo to that repository.

![Connect](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/image-4.png)

After the connection succeeds you will see a link to your GitHub repository.

![Connected Repository](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/image-5.png)

Click the link to return to GitHub. You should see a little brown dot next to the commit hash (1).

This shows that your deployment is in progress, it will take about 50 seconds.

![Zuplo deployment run](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/brown-dot.png)

On the deployment page, you will see **Deployment has Completed!!** and below that's the link to your new environment.

1. Deploy another Environment

Zuplo makes it easy for teams to collaborate by allowing teams to create many preview environments.

Let's create a branch called `development`

![Create new branch](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/60cdeb36-ab7d-42f9-a8c2-1f7931f80ca6.png)

Wait about 20s and head back to Zuplo - you should see a new entry in the environment dropdown called `development`.

1. Push a Change to 'development'

Let's make a simple change to our `working-copy` environment. Let's do something simple like capitalize the **Summary** field from 'Get all todos' to 'Get All Todos'.

![Changes Summary](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/image-6.png)

Save your changes. Click the GitHub button at bottom left and choose **Commit & Push**.

![Commit & Push](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/image-7.png)

Enter a description of your change in the dialog that pops up:

   <ModalScreenshot>

![Change Summary](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/image-8.png)

   </ModalScreenshot>

Click **Commit & Push** will create a new temporary branch in GitHub with a name `zup-...`.

   <ModalScreenshot>

![Create PR](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/image-9.png)

   </ModalScreenshot>

This will navigate you to the screen in GitHub that allows you to create a Pull Request.

![GitHub PR](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/875b164d-b7ef-4f46-9cdb-8d59354b5b93.png)

When ready, click **Merge pull request**.

![Merge PR](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/e8c68072-35dc-462a-8161-7a44e40fa1df.png)

Once merged, you'll want to delete that temporary branch.

![Delete branch](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/51a25aa0-cdce-4112-ba2e-e56f42a9044d.png)

The successful merge will trigger a rebuild and deployment of `development` with your change.

This shows how you can use widely recognized GitOps practices to manage how code flows through your environments using Pull Requests and protected branches.

## Troubleshooting

I don't see my repository listed in Zuplo project settings.

- Make sure you've granted access to the project with the Zuplo GitHub App, you
can [check that configuration here](https://github.com/apps/zuplo/installations/new)

I've connected my Zuplo project to a GitHub repository but get access errors when running commits, pulls or try to open a pull request.

- If you are the owner of the project, make sure you've granted access to the
project with the Zuplo GitHub App, you can [check that configuration here](https://github.com/apps/zuplo/installations/new)
- If this Zuplo project was shared with you, make sure you are a GitHub
collaborator. This can be verified by going to the GitHub repository > Settings > Collaborators section.
- If the GitHub repository has been renamed or moved to a different
organization, try disconnecting and reconnecting to it. You can do this by going to your Zuplo project's settings > Source Control section
