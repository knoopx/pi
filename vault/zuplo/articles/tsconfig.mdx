title: Typescript Configuration (tsconfig.json)
sidebar_label: Typescript Config
---

Zuplo projects use Typescript for custom code. At the root of every project is a `tsconfig.json` file that specifies the configuration for the Typescript compiler.

This file is automatically generated by Zuplo and shouldn't be modified.

When developing in the Zuplo Portal or running the `zuplo dev` command locally, the build will automatically fix this file for you.

The recommended `tsconfig.json` file is shown below.

```json
{
  "include": ["modules/**/*", ".zuplo/**/*", "tests/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["./node_modules", "./dist"],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "ESNext",
    "target": "ES2022",
    "lib": ["ESNext", "WebWorker", "Webworker.Iterable"],
    "preserveConstEnums": true,
    "moduleResolution": "Bundler",
    "useUnknownInCatchVariables": false,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "importHelpers": true,
    "removeComments": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "experimentalDecorators": true
  }
}
```

## Updating the tsconfig.json File

The `tsconfig.json` file isn't shown in the Zuplo Portal.

## Troubleshooting

This section contains common issues that you may encounter if you have used unsupported settings in the `tsconfig.json` file and are migrating to the recommended configuration.

### Build Warning: This project's tsconfig.json wasn't set to the recommended settings. Custom settings may cause build issues.

![Build Warning](../../public/media/tsconfig/image.png)

This warning is shown when the `tsconfig.json` file isn't set to the recommended settings.

:::info{title="Note"}

Depending on when your project was created, you might see this warning even if you never edited the `tsconfig.json` file.

### Build Error: Couldn't resolve "modules/my-module"

If you have a module that isn't being resolved and the module doesn't start with a path indicator like `./` or `../`, you either need to change the import to use the path indicator or add a `paths` setting to your `tsconfig.json` file.

For example, if you have the following import:

```typescript
import { myFunction } from "modules/my-module";
```

You can either change the import to:

```typescript
import { myFunction } from "./modules/my-module";
```

Or add the `baseUrl` and `paths` setting to your `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "modules/*": ["./modules/*"]
    }
  }
}
```
