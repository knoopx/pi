title: OAuth Authentication
---

Zuplo comes with build-in and extensible OAuth policies out of the box.

Some of the built-in policies are listed below.

- [OpenId JWT Authentication Policy](../policies/open-id-jwt-auth-inbound.mdx)
- [Auth0 JWT Authentication Policy](../policies/auth0-jwt-auth-inbound.mdx)
- [Okta JWT Authentication Policy](../policies/okta-jwt-auth-inbound.mdx)
- [AWS Cognito JWT Authentication Policy](../policies/cognito-jwt-auth-inbound.mdx)

## Request User

The OAuth policies will validate and decode the incoming JWT and add the data from the JWT.

The user's identifier (also known as the `sub` or subject) is available on the `request.user.sub` property.

```ts
async function (request: ZuploRequest, context: ZuploContext) {
  // Log the user's sub
  context.log.debug(`User ${request.user.sub} is authenticated`)

  // Check a custom claim
  if (request.user.data["orgId"] === "1234") {
    // do something
  }
}
```

## Authorization Header

The built-in policies will validate the incoming JWT on the Authorization header.

It isn't recommended to validate the Access Token on both the gateway and the backend.

If you would like to remove the authorization header after you use one of the authorization policies, add the [Remove Request Headers](/docs/policies/remove-headers-inbound) policy after the authorization policy and set it to remove the `Authorization` header.
