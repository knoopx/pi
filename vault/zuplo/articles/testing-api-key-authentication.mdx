title: Testing API Key Authentication
---

When running tests there are several ways you might want to handle API Key authentication.

## Testing Locally

When running API key Authentication locally, if you [link the project](/docs/cli/link.mdx) to an project the same API Key The same bucket will be shared by both your development (working copy) environment and local development.

## Setting the API Key Bucket Name

Either locally or in CI/CD you can specify any API Key Bucket on the [API Key Authentication](/docs/policies/api-key-inbound) policy by setting the `bucketName` property.

## Selectively Disabling

:::danger

Be extremely careful using this strategy. If configured incorrectly this could leave your API open to unauthorized access.

Another option is to disable authentication on endpoints for testing purposes.

enforce authentication with this setting disabled, you can create a policy that comes after that selectively enforces auth based on some condition.

For example, an environment variable flag could be used to disable auth with the following policy.

```ts
import {
  ZuploContext,
  ZuploRequest,
  environment,
  HttpProblems,
} from "@zuplo/runtime";

export default async function enforceAuth(
  request: ZuploRequest,
  context: ZuploContext,
) {
  if (environment.DISABLE_AUTH === "AUTH_DISABLED") {
    return request;
  }

  if (!request.user) {
    return HttpProblems.unauthorized(request, context);
  }

  return request;
}
```
