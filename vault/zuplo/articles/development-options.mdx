Zuplo offers both a local and web-based development experiences.

## Local Development

The [local experience](./local-development.mdx) allows users to run both the API Gateway and Dev Portal locally.

Local development is available for all customers regardless of their deployment model.

Local development is the fastest way to develop and test your APIs as you can test changes immediately without waiting for a deployment.

## Web-Based Development Experience

:::note{title="Managed Dedicated"}

Working copy environments aren't available for customers using the [managed dedicated deployment model](../dedicated/overview.mdx).

:::

The web-based development experience on (portal.zuplo.com) allows customers on our managed-edge deployment model to make edits to their project right from within the browser.

The working copy environment is a special environment that's unique to each developer.

The working copy environment isn't intended for production use and shouldn't be used as such.
