:::note

Most GitHub users don't need custom CI/CD. The [built-in GitHub integration](./source-control-setup-github.mdx) deploys automatically on every push.

Use custom GitHub Actions when you need approval gates, multi-stage deployments, or tests that must pass before deploying.

:::

GitHub Actions gives you complete control over when, how, and where your API gateway deploys.

## Why GitHub Actions with Zuplo?

The Zuplo CLI integrates seamlessly into GitHub Actions workflows, giving you:

**Full pipeline control** — Run linting, security scans, and integration tests before any deployment.

**Environment per pull request** — Every PR gets its own isolated Zuplo environment.

**Test before you ship** — Run your test suite against a local Zuplo development server in CI before deploying anywhere.

**Tag-based releases** — Deploy only when you're ready. Tag a release in Git and let your pipeline handle the rest.

## How It Works

The Zuplo CLI handles deployment, testing, and environment management.

```bash
# Deploy to Zuplo (environment name from branch or --environment flag)
npx zuplo deploy --api-key "$ZUPLO_API_KEY"

# Run tests against any Zuplo environment
npx zuplo test --endpoint https://your-env.zuplo.dev

# Clean up environments you no longer need
npx zuplo delete --environment pr-123 --api-key "$ZUPLO_API_KEY"

# Test locally before deploying
npx zuplo dev  # starts local server on port 9000
```

Capture the deployment URL from the deploy command output to pass to subsequent test steps.

## Prerequisites

1. **Disconnect the GitHub integration** — Custom CI/CD replaces automatic
deployments. Go to **Settings** > **Source Control** and click **Disconnect** to prevent double deployments.

2. **Add your API key** — Store your Zuplo API key as a GitHub secret named
`ZUPLO_API_KEY`. Find your key in the Zuplo portal under **Settings** > **API Keys**.

## Examples

Start with the workflow that matches your needs:

- **[Basic Deployment](./ci-cd-github/basic-deployment.mdx)** — Deploy on every
push to main
- **[Deploy and Test](./ci-cd-github/deploy-and-test.mdx)** — Run tests after
deployment
- **[PR Preview Environments](./ci-cd-github/pr-preview-environments.mdx)** —
Isolated environments for every pull request
- **[Local Testing in CI](./ci-cd-github/local-testing.mdx)** — Test with local
Zuplo server before deploying
- **[Tag-Based Releases](./ci-cd-github/tag-based-releases.mdx)** — Deploy only
on tagged releases
- **[Multi-Stage Deployment](./ci-cd-github/multi-stage-deployment.mdx)** —
Staging to production with approval gates
- **[Automatic Cleanup](./ci-cd-github/cleanup-on-branch-delete.mdx)** — Delete
environments when branches are deleted
