title: Secure Tunnel
---

For customers running on bare metal, on-premises, or other non-cloud providers tunnels provides a way to secure your backend without mTLS or IAM.

The way this system works is by deploying a small service inside your network or VPC that makes a secure outbound connection to Zuplo's infrastructure.

1. Because the tunnel makes an outbound connection, there is no need for your
API to be exposed on the internet at all.
2. All traffic between Zuplo and your API is fully encrypted.
3. You eliminate the need to configure complex ingress, firewall, or other types
of policies to route traffic into your API. install the tunnel and Zuplo takes care of the rest.

## How does the Tunnel Work?

The Zuplo tunnel can run on virtually any infrastructure. The most common way users install the tunnel is as a Docker container, but we can provide you a build in virtually any format (for example an Azure VM, etc.).

When the tunnel service connects to the Zuplo network, traffic from your gateway can be routed to internal services running in your network or VPC.

The example below illustrates how the Zuplo tunnel would be configured in an AWS ECS Cluster.

## Is this Secure?

Zuplo builds on top of many different tools to ensure that your gateway and API stay secure.

All traffic is terminated at the edge with SSL certificates and encrypted through the entire route to your API.

Every request is logged and you can configure Zuplo's logs to push to the log service of your choice.

## How will tunnels perform?

Most customers are fine running two instances of the tunnel service for redundancy in the event one pod/service fails.

## How should I Configure the Tunnel?

You should run your tunnel with an IAM role or other network policies that only allow the tunnel to make requests to the network services that you want your Gateway to access.

For details on how to configure a tunnel on your network see [the setup guide](tunnel-setup.mdx).
