title: "Installing Packages"
---

You can install packages from npm to use in your Zuplo Gateway. This can help with code completion and hover tips.

However, bear in mind, these might not work out-of-the-box in the cloud (for example, working-copy and edge environments), as Zuplo for security reasons doesn't allow all packages to be installed.

There are workarounds though. If you need a package to be available, you can try to _bundle_ it.

We're looking into ways to simplify bringing in your own modules. We're proceeding carefully as we want to ensure that we can provide a secure and reliable experience for our users.
